== GETTING STARTED ==

A Quick start is shown in this [video](https://vollstart.com/event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner/docs/#quickstart).
A good first start is to open the event ticket admin area and create a list first, if not already done or if you do not want to use the default ticket list.
Go to your WooCommerce product and activate the ticket sale option and set the list.
Check out all the possible options in the event ticket admin area to understand, how to tweak your usages of plugin.
Optional: Then add your ticket number by importing (add button at the ticket table) or assign the ticket list to your products.
Optional: If you need a validation form for your users, to check the ticket number, then please add the shortcode **[sasoEventTicketsValidator]** to a page.

= Steps to start =
- Go to the admin area and click on menu "Event Tickets".
- Click on button "Add" next to the heading "List".
- Go to your "ticket" product and set the option with in the product settings "Event Tickets"
*To scan the QR code of the sold tickets at the entrance:*
- Go to the admin area and click on menu "Event Tickets".
- Click on the button "Ticket Scanner" at the top area
- Scan tickets and redeem them

Try it out first, before you go Premium! ["Here you can find the premium plugin"](https://vollstart.com/event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner).

== Woocommerce support for auto-generating tickets ==
**Supports version 6+**
**You can use this plugin to auto-generate tickets and codes for your woocommerce products**
* Create a code list
* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should receive a ticket
* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should receive a code - if needed
* Click on "Event Tickets" in the attribute area of your product
* Choose the "List" that will be used for this product

Everytime this product is sold, it will get a new generated ticket number/code or use an unused one within your list (This need to be activated within the option settings). The new code will be added to the code list you set on your WooCommerce product and to the product sale too.
If the sold product quantity in the order is more than 1, then a ticket number/code will be generated for each element. The code will be generated after the purchase. In case of a refund the code will be recovered and marked as unused, so that it can be reused.

*E.g.: Your customer bought 2 of the same product within one order, then 2 tickets will be generated and stored to the product item within this order.*

= WooCommerce Ticket Features =
* Automatically create and assign tickets for physical products and digital products
* Recover tickets assigned to refunded orders
* Option to reuse the recovered tickets with the latest orders
* Automatically deliver the tickets with the complete order email
* Automatically a ticket as PDF for download and add the download link to the complete order email.
* Automatically deliver the tickets and download URL with the optional PDF invoice "WooCommerce PDF Invoices"
* Download a flyer for your event or party

= WooCommerce Code Features =
* Automatically create and assign codes for physical products and digital products
* Recover code assigned to refunded orders
* Option to reuse the recovered codes with the latest orders
* Automatically deliver the codes with the complete order email
* Automatically deliver the codes with the optional PDF invoice "WooCommerce PDF Invoices"

**Please note:**
If you exceed your limit (*no limits for premium user*) of the amount of possible tickets/codes, then the ticket/code added to the sold product will be a text information: **"Please contact our support for the code"**.
This way your business is not harmed and your customer can contact you to get a code manually. The format of the code will be **12345-12345-12345-12345** if you do not set a generation format within the options.

== WooCommerce PDF Invoices support to display the ticket numbers on the PDFs ==
If you use ["WooCommerce PDF Invoices"](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/), then the generated ticket numbers/codes are displayed on the generated PDFs too!
The supported PDF plugin is from Ewout Fernhout.

== WooCommerce Ticket Sale ==
You can add a list to your product and sell tickets. The ticket will be added to the sale informations for you and your client.
The client will also have a link to check the ticket and mark the ticket as used, only if the order is set to completed. This will mark the ticket as redeemed.
You can check the entrance by letting your customer show the confirmation page and hit on the "redeem"-button.
Or you scan the QR code of the ticket with the ticket scanner (included). The ticket is also available as PDF for download to your customers.
[Checkout the video, how it works](https://vollstart.com/event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner/docs/#ticket)

== Frontend ==
We have different frontend elements. Just to sell tickets and scan them, you do not need to add any shortcodes to your pages.

= Frontend event tickets =
Your customer will receive a specific URL to the ticket detail page. You can control which information to display. additional they can download the ticket as a PDF.
The ticket will contain a QR code, that can be scanned by you or your team (no login to WordPress needed) and redeem the ticket.
[Watch the video for it](https://vollstart.com/event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner/docs/#quickstart)

= Frontend event list =
You can use the shortcode [sasoEventTicketsValidator_eventsview] to display the upcoming events. Default is to start for the whole month and the next 2 months.
You can add the parameter months_to_show to control how many months you want to show. Eg. months_to_show="3"

= Frontend to validate the ticket number =
* Use the shortcode **[sasoEventTicketsValidator]**
* Create a page or use an existing one and add the shortcode to the page
* The shortcode will be replaced for your users by a form to enter the ticket number and a button to validate the ticket. This allows you to surround the form with your own heading and instruction.
* Each ticket number has a display version (e.g. XYZXYZ -> XYZ-XYZ), so it is easier for your user to read the ticket number.
* The check will remove the display delimiter "-", ":", " " for the check automatically.
* So your user can enter the ticket number with or without delimiters.

If you use CVV on a code and the user enter the ticket number that requires a cvv, then your user will be ask to enter the CVV.
The user could enter the CVV immediately with the code. Separate the value with a ":". E.g: XYZXYZ:1234.

It is possible to prefill the ticket number validation form with a ticket number.
Add the parameter "code" to your page URL to create a link that prefills the form.
*E.g https://vollstart.com/serial-codes/?code=123-456-789*

= Form options for expert =
You can use your own input, trigger and output HTML element.
Add the id parameter to your HTML elements and pass them to the shortcode as corresponding parameter.
You can add also your own JS function name that will be called before the ticket number is checked on the server and also if the result comes back.
*[sasoEventTicketsValidator inputid="" triggerid="" outputid="" jspre="" jsafter=""]*
